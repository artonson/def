# Running inference with a pre-trained DEF network

For the most part, running testing with a pre-trained DEF 
model is described in [training manual](training.md). 

Here, we mention a helper SLURM script `run_inference.sbatch.sh`
which serves as an interface to the inference script.
You can use the script as an example for building you own
inference script.
