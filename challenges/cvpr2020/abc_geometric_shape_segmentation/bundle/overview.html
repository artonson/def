<h2>ABC Geometry Challenge: Geometric Shape Segmentation</h2>

<p>In the geometric shape segmentation challenge, participants have to predict segments of 3D point clouds which are located close to the feature lines of an underlying shape. In the present dataset and challenge, feature lines are identified with surface lines where surface normals undergo a change of at least 18&#176;. Point clouds of CAD models are provided, which are randomly sampled from the surface with 4K points. For all points, ground truth binary segmentation masks derived from the CAD surface descriptions are given in the training set and have to be estimated for the validation and test sets.</p>
