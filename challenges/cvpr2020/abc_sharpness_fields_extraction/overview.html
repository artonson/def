<h2>ABC Geometry Challenge: Sharpness Fields Extraction</h2>

<p>In the sharpness fields extraction challenge, participants have to estimate distances to the closest feature lines for 3D point clouds. In the present dataset and challenge, feature lines are identified with surface lines where surface normals undergo a change of at least 15&#176;. Point clouds of CAD models are provided, which are randomly sampled from the surface with 4K points. 
For all points, ground truth distances to nearest feature lines derived from the CAD surface descriptions are given in the training set and have to be estimated for the validation and test sets.</p>
