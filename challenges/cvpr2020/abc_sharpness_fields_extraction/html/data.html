<h3>Data</h3>

<p>We supply 3 datasets and a starting kit (with evaluation and file loading python code)</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Training datasets:</b> 300k point clouds with ground truth distance field values in 3&nbsp;varying 3D resolutions: 0.02&thinsp;mm/point (high resolution), 0.05&thinsp;mm/point (medium), and 0.125&thinsp;mm/point (low). The spatial size of each CAD model has been selected such that the 75% longest feature lines in that model are sampled with at least 8 points at the low 0.125&thinsp;mm 3D resolution. Each point has an associated nonnegative distance value associated to it, with distance values thresholded to a maximum of 1.0 across the point cloud (i.e., distance values larger than 1.0 are set to 1.0). We provide 100k annotated samples per each of the above 3D resolutions.

<br />

There are two versions of the training dataset: A textfile version (1 point cloud per file) and a python/numpy version (16k point clouds per file).
